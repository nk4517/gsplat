    """Rasterize a set of 2D Gaussians (N) to a batch of image planes (C).

    This function supports a handful of features, similar to the :func:`rasterization` function.

    .. warning::
        This function is currently not differentiable w.r.t. the camera intrinsics `Ks`.

    Args:
        means: The 3D centers of the Gaussians. [..., N, 3]
        quats: The quaternions of the Gaussians (wxyz convension). It's not required to be normalized. [..., N, 4]
        scales: The scales of the Gaussians. [..., N, 3]
        opacities: The opacities of the Gaussians. [..., N]
        colors: The colors of the Gaussians. [..., (C,) N, D] or [..., (C,) N, K, 3] for SH coefficients.
        viewmats: The world-to-cam transformation of the cameras. [..., C, 4, 4]
        Ks: The camera intrinsics. [..., C, 3, 3]
        width: The width of the image.
        height: The height of the image.
        near_plane: The near plane for clipping. Default is 0.01.
        far_plane: The far plane for clipping. Default is 1e10.
        radius_clip: Gaussians with 2D radius smaller or equal than this value will be
            skipped. This is extremely helpful for speeding up large scale scenes.
            Default is 0.0.
        eps2d: An epsilon added to the egienvalues of projected 2D covariance matrices.
            This will prevents the projected GS to be too small. For example eps2d=0.3
            leads to minimal 3 pixel unit. Default is 0.3.
        sh_degree: The SH degree to use, which can be smaller than the total
            number of bands. If set, the `colors` should be [(C,) N, K, 3] SH coefficients,
            else the `colors` should [(C,) N, D] post-activation color values. Default is None.
        packed: Whether to use packed mode which is more memory efficient but might or
            might not be as fast. Default is True.
        tile_size: The size of the tiles for rasterization. Default is 16.
            (Note: other values are not tested)
        backgrounds: The background colors. [C, D]. Default is None.
        render_mode: The rendering mode. Supported modes are "RGB", "D", "ED", "RGB+D",
            and "RGB+ED". "RGB" renders the colored image, "D" renders the accumulated depth, and
            "ED" renders the expected depth. Default is "RGB".
        sparse_grad (Experimental): If true, the gradients for {means, quats, scales} will be stored in
            a COO sparse layout. This can be helpful for saving memory. Default is False.
        absgrad: If true, the absolute gradients of the projected 2D means
            will be computed during the backward pass, which could be accessed by
            `meta["means2d"].absgrad`. Default is False.
        channel_chunk: The number of channels to render in one go. Default is 32.
            If the required rendering channels are larger than this value, the rendering
            will be done looply in chunks.
        distloss: If true, use distortion regularization to get better geometry detail.
        depth_mode: render depth mode. Choose from expected depth and median depth.
        track_domination: If true, track the number of touched and dominated Gaussians. arXiv:2403.14166
        extra_features: Optional extra features to render alongside colors. [..., N, F] where F is the
            number of extra feature channels. These will be rendered and returned in meta["rendered_extras"].
    Returns:
        A tuple:

        **render_colors**: The rendered colors. [..., C, height, width, X].
        X depends on the `render_mode` and input `colors`. If `render_mode` is "RGB",
        X is D; if `render_mode` is "D" or "ED", X is 1; if `render_mode` is "RGB+D" or
        "RGB+ED", X is D+1.

        **render_alphas**: The rendered alphas. [..., C, height, width, 1].

        **render_normals**: The rendered normals. [..., C, height, width, 3].

        **surf_normals**: surface normal from depth. [..., C, height, width, 3]

        **render_distort**: The rendered distortions. [..., C, height, width, 1].
        L1 version, different from L2 version in 2DGS paper.

        **render_median**: The rendered median depth. [..., C, height, width, 1].

        **meta**: A dictionary of intermediate results of the rasterization.
